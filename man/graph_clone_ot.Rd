\usage{
graph_clone_ot(graph, cell_clone_prob, cache = 5000, cores = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{An `igraph` object representing the cell-cell distance graph.}

\item{cell_clone_prob}{A matrix of clone membership probabilities (cells Ã— clones).}

\item{cache}{Integer. Maximum number of pooled cells retained in memory during each subgraph operation (default: 5000).}

\item{cores}{Integer. Number of parallel threads to use (default: 1).}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns `group1`, `group2`, and `dis` representing OT distances between clone pairs.
}
\description{
Parallel Clone-to-Clone OT Computation on Cell Graph
}
\details{
Computes clone-to-clone optimal transport (OT) distances in parallel by first partitioning clones
and applying `graph_clone_ot_sub()` on each group. Supports memory-efficient computation with subset caching.
