\usage{
mnn_dist(dis, k)
}
\arguments{
\item{dis}{A symmetric distance matrix (as `dist` or matrix) representing pairwise distances.}

\item{k}{Integer. Number of nearest neighbors to consider.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns `i` and `j`, representing mutual nearest neighbor pairs with `i < j`.
}
\description{
Identify Mutual Nearest Neighbors (MNN) from Distance Matrix
}
\details{
Computes mutual nearest neighbors between items based on a symmetric distance matrix.
A pair (i, j) is considered mutual if i is among the k nearest neighbors of j, and j is among the k nearest neighbors of i.

\examples{
dist_mat <- dist(matrix(rnorm(100), ncol = 5))
mnn_pairs <- mnn_dist(dist_mat, k = 5)
head(mnn_pairs)
