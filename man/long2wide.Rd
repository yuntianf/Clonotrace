\usage{
long2wide(long, row_names_from, col_names_from, values_from, symmetric = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{long}{A data frame in long format with at least three columns: row ID, column ID, and value.}

\item{row_names_from}{Name of the column in `long` to use as row names in the output.}

\item{col_names_from}{Name of the column in `long` to use as column names in the output.}

\item{values_from}{Name of the column in `long` to use as cell values in the output matrix.}

\item{symmetric}{Logical. If `TRUE`, the output will be forced to be symmetric by duplicating reversed entries.}
}
\value{
A wide-format data frame or matrix where row names and column names are as specified, and cell values come from `values_from`.
}
\description{
Convert Long Format Data Frame to Symmetric or Asymmetric Wide Matrix
}
\details{
Converts a long-format data frame with row/column/value identifiers into a wide-format matrix-style data frame.
Optionally enforces matrix symmetry by duplicating and merging reversed entries.

\examples{
long_df <- data.frame(from = c("A", "B"), to = c("B", "A"), value = c(1, 2))
mat <- long2wide(long_df, row_names_from = "from", col_names_from = "to", values_from = "value")
print(mat)
