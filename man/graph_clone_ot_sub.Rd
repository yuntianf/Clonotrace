\usage{
graph_clone_ot_sub(graph, cell_clone_prob, target_clone = NULL, cache = 5000)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{An `igraph` object representing cell-cell distances.}

\item{cell_clone_prob}{A matrix of clone membership probabilities (cells Ã— clones).}

\item{target_clone}{Optional. Vector of clone indices to compute pairwise OT from (default: `NULL` = all).}

\item{cache}{Integer. Maximum number of pooled cells retained in memory during iteration (default: 5000).}
}
\value{
A matrix with columns: `group1`, `group2`, `dis` for each clone pair and their OT distance.
}
\description{
Compute Pairwise OT Distances Between Clones Using Graph-Based Subset Strategy
}
\details{
Computes clone-to-clone optimal transport distances by expanding a local graph-based cell neighborhood
using a subset pool strategy to reduce computational burden.
