\usage{
clone_2_ot(distance, group1_mass, group2_mass)
}
\arguments{
\item{distance}{A numeric cost matrix of pairwise distances (rows = group 1 cells, cols = group 2 cells).}

\item{group1_mass}{A numeric vector of mass/probabilities for group 1 (length must equal number of rows in `distance`).}

\item{group2_mass}{A numeric vector of mass/probabilities for group 2 (length must equal number of columns in `distance`).}
}
\value{
A single numeric value representing the OT distance between the two groups.
}
\description{
Compute Optimal Transport Distance Between Two Clones
}
\details{
Calculates the optimal transport (OT) distance between two sets of cells (e.g., clones) based on
a cost matrix and their mass distributions. Uses the `transport` package for solving the OT plan.
