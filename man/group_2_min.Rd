\usage{
group_2_min(distance, group1, group2, k = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{distance}{A numeric matrix of pairwise distances (e.g., from `dist()` or `igraph::distances()`).}

\item{group1}{A vector of row indices corresponding to group 1.}

\item{group2}{A vector of column indices corresponding to group 2.}

\item{k}{Integer. Number of nearest neighbors to average over (default: 3).}
}
\value{
A single numeric value representing the symmetric average distance between the two groups.
}
\description{
Compute Average Minimal Pairwise Distance Between Two Groups
}
\details{
Estimates a symmetric inter-group distance based on averaging the top-k smallest pairwise distances between two groups.
This is useful for comparing cell groups or clone sets using a local-neighborhood approximation of intergroup proximity.
If the submatrix between `group1` and `group2` has only one value, that value is returned.
Otherwise, the function returns the mean of the average top-k distances across both rows and columns.

dist_mat <- matrix(runif(100), nrow = 10)
d <- group_2_min(dist_mat, group1 = 1:3, group2 = 4:6, k = 2)
