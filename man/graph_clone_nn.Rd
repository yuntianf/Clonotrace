\usage{
graph_clone_nn(
  graph,
  cell_clone_prob,
  prob_thresh = 0.1,
  k = 2,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{An `igraph` object representing the cell-cell distance graph.}

\item{cell_clone_prob}{A numeric matrix of clone membership probabilities (cells Ã— clones).}

\item{prob_thresh}{Threshold for binarizing clone assignment probabilities (default: 0.1).}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Whether to print progress during processing (default: FALSE).}

\item{nn_k}{Integer. Number of nearest neighbors to select for each clone comparison (default: 2).}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns `group1`, `group2`, and `dis` indicating the NN distance between clones.
}
\description{
Compute Clone-to-Clone Nearest Neighbor Distances on a Cell Graph
}
\details{
Calculates clone-level nearest neighbor distances based on a shared cell-cell graph. Uses binarized
clone membership to find inter-clone distances, and applies a greedy k-nearest neighbor approximation.
