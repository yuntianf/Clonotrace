\usage{
acct(T_mat)
}
\arguments{
\item{T_mat}{A square transition matrix (symmetric, row-normalized).}
}
\value{
A matrix of accumulated commute times between all pairs of nodes.
}
\description{
Compute Accumulated Commute Time Matrix from Transition Matrix
}
\details{
Computes the accumulated commute time (ACT) matrix from a normalized transition matrix.
This is used as a basis for diffusion-based distances and pseudotime inference.

\examples{
mat <- matrix(runif(100), nrow = 10)
mat <- mat / rowSums(mat)
act <- acct(mat)
print(dim(act))
