\usage{
clone_disance(
  embedding,
  cell_clone_prob,
  outpath,
  graph_k = 10,
  overwrite = FALSE,
  exact = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{embedding}{A numeric matrix of cell embeddings (cells × dimensions).}

\item{cell_clone_prob}{A numeric matrix of clone membership probabilities (cells × clones).}

\item{outpath}{File path to save and load intermediate graph and distance results.}

\item{graph_k}{Integer. Number of neighbors to use in the SNN graph (default: 10).}

\item{overwrite}{Logical. Whether to overwrite previously saved graphs and results (default: FALSE).}

\item{exact}{Logical. If `TRUE`, computes exact OT-based clone distances; otherwise, uses approximate NN (default: FALSE).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to `graph_clone_ot()` or `graph_clone_nn()`.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns `group1`, `group2`, and `dis`, representing pairwise clone distances.
}
\description{
Compute Clone-to-Clone Distances from Cell Embedding and Clone Assignments
}
\details{
Constructs a cell-cell shared nearest neighbor (SNN) graph from an embedding and uses it to estimate
pairwise distances between clones. Users can choose between exact OT-based distances or fast
approximate k-nearest neighbor methods.
