\usage{
filter_network(adj, n_neighbors = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{adj}{A symmetric adjacency matrix (numeric or sparse).}

\item{n_neighbors}{Integer. The minimum number of neighbors each node must have to remain in the network (default: 5).}
}
\value{
A filtered adjacency matrix containing only nodes with at least `n_neighbors` connections.
}
\description{
Filter Sparse Graph to Retain Nodes with Minimum Degree
}
\details{
Iteratively removes nodes from a symmetric adjacency matrix until all remaining nodes have at least `n_neighbors` edges.
}
\examples{
mat <- matrix(sample(0:1, 100, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.9, 0.1)), nrow = 10)
mat[lower.tri(mat)] <- t(mat)[lower.tri(mat)]
diag(mat) <- 0
filtered <- filter_network(mat, n_neighbors = 2)
