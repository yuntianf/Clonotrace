\usage{
mass_filter(mass, thresh = 0.9)
}
\arguments{
\item{mass}{A numeric vector of values (e.g., weights, similarities, or densities).}

\item{thresh}{Numeric. Proportion of total cumulative mass to retain (default: 0.9).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the same length as `mass`, with low-contributing elements set to zero.
}
\description{
Filter Vector Elements by Cumulative Mass Threshold
}
\details{
Retains the top elements in a numeric vector based on cumulative mass. Elements contributing least to the total
are zeroed out until the specified proportion of total mass (`thresh`) is retained.

This function normalizes the input to sum to 1, ranks the elements by size, and sets to zero those
contributing below the cutoff needed to achieve `thresh` cumulative mass. Useful for sparsifying matrices.
}
\examples{
x <- runif(10)
filtered <- mass_filter(x, thresh = 0.8)
print(filtered)
