\title{find_mutual_nn}
\usage{
find_mutual_nn(distance, k, dis_thresh = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{distance}{A numeric symmetric distance matrix.}

\item{k}{Integer. Number of neighbors to consider per group.}

\item{dis_thresh}{Optional numeric threshold. If set, only mutual neighbors with distance < threshold are returned.}
}
\value{
A data frame of mutual nearest neighbor pairs with columns:
\describe{
  \item{group1}{Index of first group}
  \item{group2}{Index of second group}
  \item{dist}{Distance between groups}
}
}
\description{
Identify Mutual Nearest Neighbors Between Groups
}
\details{
Finds mutually shared k-nearest neighbors from both row and column perspectives of a distance matrix.
Optionally filters by a distance threshold.
}
\examples{
dist_mat <- as.matrix(dist(matrix(rnorm(100), nrow = 10)))
mnn_df <- find_mutual_nn(dist_mat, k = 3, dis_thresh = 0.5)
head(mnn_df)
