Clonotrace is a package for multimodal analysis of single cell RNA-seq data with lineage information, including lineaged-barcoded cells and immune cells. Clonotrace generates an informative clone embedding to show the clonal dynamics, and extend to pseudotime inference and fate driving gene detection.
